# Description
JavaScript exercise. Tested using Node.js version `8.9.4`.

# TODO's
- [X] Eat dinner
- [X] Figure out which testing library is being used
- [ ] Write main code
- [ ] Test code

# Potential Improvements
- Setup linting
- Add validation of inputs (eg check they're of type `number`, maybe throw `TypeError`? Or rely on JavaScript's implicit coercion?)
